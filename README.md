# componentdemo

A small demo showing a runnable component system.

When the system is running, it will print a message every three seconds.

## Usage

If you jack in in Emacs with CIDER, the user namespace in dev should be loaded by default. Then you can just say `(go)` to make it go..

For production you will run the main function. Just use `lein run` to watch it go, press any key to gracefully stop.
